   <h1><b>Chapter 11: Further Functions</b></h1>
   
   Functions are first-class objects. This means they can be passed around like other values, they can have their own properties and methods and they can accept other functions as parameters.
   
   <h3><b>Function properties and methods</b></h3>
   
   Functions can have properties and methods. Properties are attributes of the function and methods are the functions inside the function. If the method needs parameters, they are provided as arguments.
   
   !!New for me!! - The call() method can be used to set the value of this inside a function to an object that is profided as the first argument
   Example:
   
   function greeting() {
       return `Hello ${this.name}!`;
   }
   
   const trenton = { name: 'Trenton' };
   
   greeting.call(trenton);
   << "Hello Trenton"
   
   If the function needs other parameters, they must be given after the first argument which is always the value of this.
   
   function greeting(greeting='Hello') {
       return `${greeting} ${this.name}!`;
   }
   
   greeting.call(trenton,'Howdy');
   
   **Note**
   If a function doesn't refer to an object as this in its body, it can still be called using the call() method, but you need to profide null as the first argument.
   
   Caching or Memoization
   
   function square(x){
       square.cache = square.cache || {};
       if (!square.cache[x]) {
           console.log('calculating');
           square.cache[x] = x*x; 
       }
       return square.cache[x]
   }
   
   square(2); // Logs calculating
   square(4); // Logs calculating
   square(5); // Logs calculating
   square(4); // Nothing is logged because 4 was cached.
   
   <h3><b>Immediately Invoked function expressions: </b></h3>
   
   Immediately Invoked function expressions are called IFFE (iffy). It is an anonymous function that is invoded as it is defined.
   
   There is no way to remove a variable from a scope once it’s been declared. If a variable is only required temporarily, it may cause confusion if it’s still available later in the code. Even worse, the name of the variable may clash with another piece of code (an external JavaScript library, for example) resulting in errors. Placing any code that uses the temporary variable inside an IIFE will ensure it’s only available while the IIFE is invoked, then it will disappear.
   
   With ES6 you can just put your code in a code block.
   
   {
   const name = 'Trenton South'; // This might be obtained from a cookie in reality
   const days = ['Sunday','Monday','Tuesday','Wednesday','Thursday', 'Friday','Saturday'];
   const date = new Date(),today = days[date.getDay()];
   console.log(`Welcome back ${name}. Today is ${today}`);
   }
   << "Welcome back Trenton South. Today is Wednesday"
   
   <b>Self-defining functions:</b>
   
   Functions can rewrite themselves.
   
   function party(){
       console.log('Wow this is amazing!');
       party = function(){
           console.log('Been there, got the T-Shirt');
       } 
   }
   
   party(); // << "Wow this is amazing!"
   party(); // << "Been there, got the T-Shirt"
   
   **Note**
   If you assign party() to a variable before calling it, the new variable will always invoke it like it was the first call.
   
   beachParty = party;
   
   party(); // << "Wow this is amazing!"
   party(); // << "Been there, got the T-Shirt"
   beachParty(); // << "Wow this is amazing!"
   beachParty(); // << "Wow this is amazing!"
   
   If any properties have previously been set on the function, these will be lost when the function redefines itself.
   
   This is called the Lazy Definition Pattern and is often used when some initialization code is required the first time it’s invoked. This means the initialization can be done the first time it’s called, then the function can be redefined to what you want it to be for every subsequent invocation. 
   
   <b>Recursive functions:</b>
   
   A recursive function is one that invokes itself until a certain condition is met.
   
   Example:
   function factorial(n) {
       if (n === 0) {
           return 1;
       } else {
           return n * factorial(n - 1);
       } 
   }
   
   <b>Callbacks:</b>
   
   Callbacks are functions passed to other functions as arguments and then invoked inside the function they are passed to.
   
   function wait(message, callback, seconds){
       setTimeout(callback,seconds * 1000);
       console.log(message);
   }
   
   <b>Promises:</b>
   
   A promise represents the future result of an asynchronous operation. Promises don’t do anything that can’t already be achieved using callbacks, but they help simplify the process, and avoid the convoluted code that can result from using multiple callbacks.
   
   Promises end in one of two states 
     1) Resolved - The asynchronous operation was completed successfully.
     2) Rejected - The asynchronous operation didn’t work as expected, wasn’t successfully completed or resulted in an error
     
   Once a promise has been settled, the then() method can be used to deal with the outcome. This method accepts two arguments. The first is a fulfilment function that’s called when the promise is resolved. Any data returned from the resolve() function will be passed along to this function. The second argument is a rejection function that’s called if the promise is rejected. Similar to the fulfilment function, the rejection function receives any data returned from the reject() function.  
   
   const dice = {
     sides: 6,
     roll() {
       return Math.floor(this.sides * Math.random()) + 1;
     }
   }
   
   console.log("Before the roll");
   const roll = new Promise((resolve,reject) => {
     const n = dice.roll();
     if(n > 1) {
       setTimeout(()=>resolve(n),n*200);
     } else {
       setTimeout(()=>reject(n),n*200);
     }
     console.log("Promise Pending");
   });
   
   roll.then(result => console.log(`I rolled a ${result}`) )
   .catch(result => console.log(`Drat! ... I rolled a ${result}`) );
   console.log("After the roll");
   
   << "Before the roll"
   << "Promise Pending"
   << "After the roll"
   << "I rolled a 4"
   
   
   If each function that performs an asynchronous operation returns a promise, we can chain the then() methods together to form a sequential piece of code that’s easy to read.
   
   login(userName)
   .then(user => getPlayerInfo(user.id))
   .then(info => loadGame(info))
   .catch( throw error)
   
   <b>Async functions:</b>
   
   Async functions were added to the ES2017 specification. These functions are preceded by the async keyword and allow you to write asynchronous code as if it was synchronous. This is achieved by using the await operator before an asynchronous function. This will wrap the return value of the function in a promise that can then be assigned to a variable. The next line of code is not executed until the promise is resolved.
   
   let hello = async () => { return "Hello" };
   hello().then((value) => console.log(value))
   
   
   <b>Functions that return functions:</b>
   
   ** This portion of the book was hard to follow, but the example makes sense **
   
   function greeter(greeting = 'Hello') {
      return function() {
         console.log(greeting);
      } 
   }
   
   const englishGreeter = greeter();
   englishGreeter();
   << Hello
   
   const frenchGreeter = greeter('Bonjour');
   frenchGreeter();
   << Bonjour
   
   const germanGreeter = greeter('Guten Tag');
   germanGreeter();
   << Guten Tag
   
   <h2><b>Closures:</b></h2>
   
   A closure is a reference to a variable that was created inside the scope of another function, but is then kept alive and used in another part of the program.
   
   A closure is formed when a function returns another function that then maintains Further Functions 417access to any variables created in the original function’s scope. In the following example, two variables, a and b, are created in the scope of the closure() function. This then returns an anonymous arrow function that maintains access to the variables a and b even after the closure() function has been invoked: 
   
   ** I don't like the first example in the book because it is just as easily or I would say more easily by a regular function **
   ** I like this second example better **
   
   function counter(start){
      let i = start;
      return function() {
         return i++;
      } 
   }
   
   const count = counter(1);
   count();
   << 1
   count();
   << 2
   
   <h2><b>Generators</b></h2>
   
   Generators are special functions used to produce iterators that maintain the state of a value. To define a generator function, an asterisk symbol (*) is placed after the function declaration, like so:
   
   function* exampleGenerator() {
       // code for the generator goes here
   }
   
   Calling a generator function doesn’t actually run any of the code in the function; it returns a Generator object that can be used to create an iterator that implements a next() method that returns a value every time the next() method is called.
   
   function* generator(start) {
     while(true) {
       yield start++;
     }
   }
   
   const g = generator(0);
   
   console.log(g.next().value);
   << 1
   console.log(g.next().value);
   << 2
   console.log(g.next().value);
   << 3
   console.log(g.next()); // Notice I didn't ask for the value. An object is returned.
   << [object Object] {
     done: false,
     value: 4
   }
   
   ** Another Example **
   
   function* generator2(start) {
     while(start < 5) {
       yield ++start;
     } 
     return;
   }
   
   const g2 = generator2(0);
   
   do {
     result = g2.next();
     if (result.value) console.log(result.value);
   } while (result.value != undefined);
   
   << 1

   <h2><b>Introduction to functional programming:</b></h2>
   
   Functional programming is a programming paradigm where programs are constructed by applying and composing functions. It is a declarative programming paradigm in which function definitions are trees of expressions that map values to other values, rather than a sequence of imperative statements which update the running state of the program.
   
   <h2><b>Currying:</b></h2>
   
   Currying is a process that involves the partial application of functions. 
   
   A function is said to be curried when not all arguments have been supplied to the function, so it returns another function that retains the arguments already provided, and expects the remaining arguments that were omitted when the original function was called. A final result is only returned once all the expected arguments have eventually been provided.
