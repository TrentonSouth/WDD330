   A fragment of code that produces a value is called an expression. Every value that is written literally is an expression. An expression between parentheses is alson an expression, as is a binary operator applied to two expressions or a unary operator applied to one.

   When a binding points at a value, that does not mean it is tied to that value forever. The = operator can be used at any time on existing bindings to disconnect them from their current value and have them point to a new one.
   
   Binding names cannot be keywords. They must start with a letter, _, or $. They can contain numbers after the first letter. There cannot be any spaces. They should be descriptive and in camel case.

   Breaking out of a loop - Having a condition false is not the only way to break out of a loop. You can use the break command at any time to exit the loop.

      <code>
      let i = 0;
      while (true) {
        if (i < 10) {
         break;
       }
       i++;

   Executing a function is called invoking, calling, or applying it.
   
   Values given to a function are called arguments.
   
   When a function produces a value, it is said to return a value.
   
   A group of statments wrapped in {} is called a block.
   
   Each binding has a scope, which is the part of the program in which the binding is visible. Variables in scope of the entire program are called global.
   
   Arrow functions use the () first and then the arrow => and then the block of code.
   
   You can send extra arguments to a function or you can send to few. If you send extra they are ignored. If you send to few, the remaining are undefined.
   
   Recursion is when a function calls itself. There needs to be a way to break out of it or it will cause a stack overflow.
