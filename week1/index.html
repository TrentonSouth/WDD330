<div>
  <div class="bold section">Rewire your brain</div>
  <div>Design for the smallest, least powerful device first. This will make you focus on your content.</div>
  <div>We need to rewire our brains going from pc and laptops to mobile devices.</div>
  <div>2007 iPhone introduced </div>
  <div>2011 paradigm shift evident.</div>
  <div>Desktops shared and replaced every 4-5 years. Mobile devices replaced every 2 years or so.</div>
  <div>Desktops average 1-2 per household. Mobile devices average 1-3 per person.</div>
  <div>Mobile traffic up 18.6% over 2013 in 2014. Over half</div>
  <div>Do mobile first.</div>
  <div>Responsive does not mean mobile first</div>
  <div>Responsive retrofitting may be a temporary fix, but mobile first should be the goal.</div>
  <div>Desktop sales in decline since 2011</div>
  <div>Mobile is not a fad. We are not going to get rid of phones and tablets</div>
  
  <div class="bold section">How to Improve UX by Understanding Users</div>
  <div>Steve Jobs said "It's really hard to design products by focus groups. A lot of times, people don't know what they want until you show it to them."</div>
  <div>Be there</div>
  <div>Be useful - Don't make users hunt for what they want.</div>
  <div>Be Quick - A single tap or click makes a difference. Make interactions smooth and seamless.</div>
  <div>Reachability Matters - 75% of people rely on their thumbs. 49% use one handed grip. Make key items be in easy to reach places.</div>
  <div>Speed Matters - Â½ second delay = 20% drop in traffic for Google. 2 second delay = 4% drop in revenue for Bing. Fastest 10% or users stay 50% longer on AOL. Reduce image usage. Use svg and Webfonts. Optimize and minify js and css. Gzip files</div>
  <div>Networks Matter - In 2013 1.8% users have 4G and 25% have 3g.</div>
  
  <div class="bold section">Better Mobile UX through Strategic Menu Design</div>
  <div>We need to be empathetic to our users' needs.</div>
  <div>Menu items work better when they are on the bottom. This is because they are easier to reach.</div>
  <div>Primary controls should be at the bottom of the app. This creates a perception of speed. This also improves engagement rates and user satisfaction.</div>
  <div>Many users don't know what the hamburger button is/does.</div>
  <div>Menu with border has highest performance increase. 20+ increase in clicks</div>
  <div>Most of the time people won't tell you when there is a problem. Less than 5% will complain.</div>
  <div>Designing Intuitive and Mobile Friendly Mobile Forms</div>
  <div>Make it simple so people can use it easily.</div>
  <div>Use placeholders instead of labels. When user starts typing put the label at the top of the field.</div>
  <div>Reduce cognitive load. </div>
  <div>Only ask for information needed.</div>
  <div>Paginate forms that need more information. If you do, include a progress indicator.</div>
  <div>Enable auto complete on forms.</div>
  <div>Passwords Matter. Masking of passwords causes errors. Masking does not help with security. Show passwords but allow users to hide them.</div>
  <div>Credit card details. Use visual indicators. If using separate fields, auto advance. Separate cc numbers.</div>
  <div>Numbers Matter. Use the best keyboard for the requested input. Large keys make input easier.</div>
  <div>Calls Matter - Don't Force a Copy and Paste. Link phone numbers so they can tap and call.</div>
  
  <div class="bold section">Designing a Better Mobile Advertising User Experience</div>
  <div>Online advertising has grown dramatically. First there was more content then advertising. now there is often more advertising than content.</div>
  <div>Auto pop-up is one of the most detested methods of advertising.</div>
  <div>Don't disguise ads as content.</div>
  <div>Don't make users scroll past ads for content. </div>
  <div>Keep ads simple and effective.</div>
  <div>Stop using popups and pop overs. Users come for content not ads. </div>
  <div>Keep ads simple and sleek.</div>
  <div>Be empathetic. If you wouldn't like it as a user, don't do it.</div>
